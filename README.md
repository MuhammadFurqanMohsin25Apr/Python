# Python

This repository contains my solutions for the Programming Fundamentals lab tasks from my first semester, which I completed using Python. Although I am currently in my third semester, this repository reflects my foundational understanding of programming concepts such as input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, conditional statements, loops, and functions. The code is kept simple and easy to understand, serving as a reference for my progress in learning core programming skills.
